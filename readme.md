<!-- Replace this with whatever GIF tool you used! -->
<!-- Note: Used MP4 video format instead of GIF as the file size was way smaller at a higher quality.-->
Video created with:
- Recorded in QuickTime Player
- Edited in Final Cut Pro
- Compressor for file format conversion
<!-- Recommended tools:
[Kap](https://getkap.co/) for macOS
[ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) for Windows
[peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) for Linux. -->

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

Compared to SwiftUI, editing the style of a given view is less intuitive and has a lower DX (developer experience) in general. Other than that I guess the biggest challenge is working with Storyboard having to fight its different constraint issues.

I can compare this to when first learning Rust where the lack of knowledge creates friction with the use of the compiler. I assume as I get better at understanding all of the hidden complexities of Storyboard I will start enjoying the experience more. I think the greatest point of friction just comes with the inherent lack of expertise in this area rather than a flaw in the way the system is built.
