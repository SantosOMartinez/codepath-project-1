As a happy-go-lucky beagle, nothing makes me happier than enjoying the simple \
pleasures of life - like a good belly rub or chasing after my favorite toy!

I'm always wagging my tail and barking with joy, especially when I'm with my \
dear owner, Charlie Brown. He brings so much happiness and love into my life, \
and I can't help but feel grateful and content whenever we're together.

And of course, I love spreading happiness and positivity to those around me. \
Whether it's through my silly antics or just being there for a friend, there's \
nothing more rewarding than putting a smile on someone's face.

So let's all be happy, my friends! Woof woof!

Zzzz... Oh! Hi there! As a beagle, I enjoy taking long naps and spending lazy \
afternoons lying on top of my doghouse. It's just so comfortable and relaxing \
up here, watching the world go by.

I mean, who doesn't love a good snooze? It's the perfect way to recharge and \
get ready for all the exciting adventures that await me. And being lazy is \
just so much fun! Sometimes it's nice to take a break from all the running \
around and just enjoy some peace and quiet.

So, if you need me, you know where to find me - snoozing on my doghouse! \
Woof woof!
"""

private let text3 = """
It all started when I decided to take a little nap on top of my doghouse, as \
I often do. But to my surprise, I woke up to find that my doghouse had taken \
flight, and I was soaring through the sky!

At first, I was a little scared, but then I remembered that I'm a beagle, and \
beagles are brave and adventurous. So I took control of my house-plane and \
started flying around, doing loops and tricks like a pro pilot.

It was such an exhilarating experience, flying high above the clouds and \
feeling the wind in my fur. And of course, being a loyal companion, I made \
sure to bring along my best friend Woodstock, who joined me on this \
incredible journey.

Eventually, I had to bring my house-plane back down to earth, but it was a \
memory that I'll never forget. Who knows, maybe one day I'll take to the \
skies again! Woof woof!
